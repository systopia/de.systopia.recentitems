# Recently viewed items menu (ABANDONED)
# Please use https://github.com/civicrm/org.civicrm.recentmenu instead

As the "Recently viewed" items are being displayed differently depending on the
CMS used to run CiviCRM, and as the famous
[Shoreditch](https://civicrm.org/extensions/shoreditch) extension requires a
theme without sidebars, the "Recently viewed" items can not be displayed in a
convenient way. This extension adds those links in a sub menu within CiviCRM's
navigation menu.

Since the navigation menu is cached, the "Recent items" sub menu is being
rebuilt for every page load and put into place via Ajax. This has the advantage
that every CiviCRM entity being viewed or edited within a popup is immediately
available within the "Recent items" sub menu.

## Installation
Simply install the extension. Works with and without the Shoreditch extension.
